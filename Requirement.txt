below is the requirement
write a javascript program with index.html, app.js, style.css files with this requiremnet below. 
1) The program should prompt to input a cvs file name. 
2) This cvs file is basically a historical data of past number picked for a lottery. 
In each drawing 4 numbered balls from 1 to 35 are picked.  In addition one bonus ball numbered from 1 to 35 is picked separately. 
The winner is the person who had picked all 4 matching numbers with the matching bonus ball. The cvs file has there columns below
"Game Name","Month","Day","Year","Num1","Num2","Num3","Num4","Bonus Ball"
The columns "Num1","Num2","Num3","Num4" represent the 4 numbers picked and the column "Bonus Ball" represents the bonus ball picked
3) The program you create should predit the likely (highest) probability of the next 5 balls (4 numbers and the bonus ball) that will be picked in the next drawing. 
4) The program should also display the probability of the each number from 1 to 35 that can be picked and show it in semicolon separted and not in table format.
